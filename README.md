# Vifrost

Vifrost generates a REST API — routes, controllers, FormRequests — directly from
your Laravel Eloquent models, and ships a typed frontend ecosystem
(`@vifrost/client`, `@vifrost/codegen`, `@vifrost/vue`) to consume it without
hand-writing HTTP calls.

**This library is NOT stable yet. Use it at your own risk.**

This README is split in three parts:

1. [Backend (Laravel package)](#1-backend-laravel-package)
2. [Models in vanilla JS/TS (`@vifrost/client`)](#2-models-in-vanilla-jsts-vifrostclient), with and without the `Registry`
3. [Vue (`@vifrost/vue`)](#3-vue-vifrostvue)

---

## 1. Backend (Laravel package)

### Requirements

- PHP `^8.3`
- Laravel `^12.0` or `^13.0` (`illuminate/database`, `illuminate/support`, `illuminate/container`, `illuminate/console`)
- [`spatie/laravel-query-builder`](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-query-builder) `^6.0`

### Installation

```bash
composer require vifrost/laravel
```

The service provider (`Vifrost\Laravel\Providers\VifrostServiceProvider`) is
auto-discovered. Optionally publish the config file to tweak it:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This publishes `config/vifrost.php`:

```php
return [
    // Columns never exposed in generated FormRequest validation rules. '*.column'
    // matches that column on every table; 'table.column' matches just one table.
    'ignored_columns' => ['*.created_at', '*.updated_at', '*.deleted_at'],

    // Directories under app/Models excluded when generating for "all" models.
    'exclude' => ['api'],

    // Where Vifrost::models() looks for Eloquent models, relative to app_path().
    // Scanned live on every call unless `php artisan vifrost:cache` has written a
    // cache file — see "Caching discovered models" below.
    'models_path' => 'Models',

    // Where `php artisan vifrost:schema` writes the models/attributes/relations JSON.
    'schema_path' => storage_path('app/vifrost-schema.json'),

    // Off by default: exposes the same JSON at schema_route_path over HTTP, for
    // adapter-generation tooling that needs to read it from a running server
    // instead of from the file the artisan command writes.
    'expose_schema_route' => false,
    'schema_route_path'   => 'api/_schema',

    // Hard ceiling on rows a collection query (index, or a nested relation
    // collection) returns per request, applied even with no ?limit= at all.
    'max_limit' => 100,

    // Per-model overrides, keyed by model FQCN. Set a model's value to null to
    // exempt it from pagination entirely (e.g. a small, rarely-changing lookup table).
    'max_limit_per_model' => [
        // \App\Models\Category::class => null,
    ],

    // Eloquent relation methods Vifrost looks for via reflection when mapping
    // a model's relations (see Mapper.php).
    'relations' => [
        'hasMany', 'hasOne', 'belongsTo', 'belongsToMany',
        'hasOneThrough', 'hasManyThrough',
        'morphOne', 'morphMany', 'morphTo', 'morphToMany', 'morphedByMany',
    ],
];
```

### Usage

Generate a FormRequest, Controller, and routes for one model:

```bash
# Store/UpdateUserRequest + UserController + routes for \App\Models\User
php artisan vifrost:api User
```

Or for every model in `app/Models` (skipping anything under the `exclude` config):

```bash
php artisan vifrost:api
```

This appends to `routes/api.php` a flat CRUD group for the model itself...

```php
Route::controller('\App\Http\Controllers\UserController')->group(function () {
    Route::get('user', 'index');
    Route::get('user/{id}', 'show');
    Route::post('user', 'store');
    Route::put('user/{id}', 'update');
    Route::delete('user/{id}', 'destroy');
});
```

...plus one-hop, read-only routes for each of its relations (see [`MakeAPICommand`](src/Commands/MakeAPICommand.php)):

```php
Route::get('user/{id}/posts', [\App\Http\Controllers\PostController::class, 'index']);
Route::get('user/{id}/posts/{childId}', [\App\Http\Controllers\PostController::class, 'show']);
```

Deeper relations (`posts.comments`) aren't routed as their own endpoint — they're
reachable in a single request via Spatie's `?include=posts.comments` on the flat
`index`/`show` route instead, since every generated controller wires
`Spatie\QueryBuilder\QueryBuilder` with `allowedIncludes` for the model's relations.

Filtering, sorting and includes are opt-in per model, and the generated controller
keeps the first two consolidated in one place — `allowedFilters()`/`allowedIncludes()`
private methods shared by both `index()` and `show()` — so extending them can't
accidentally leave the two endpoints out of sync with each other. `allowedFilters()`
starts empty and `->allowedSorts([...])` ships pre-filled with only
`['id', 'created_at', 'updated_at']`. Edit those methods in
`app/Http/Controllers/{Model}Controller.php` with whichever columns should be
filterable/sortable before relying on `.where()`/`.orderBy()` from the JS client
(part 2) — otherwise Spatie ignores the corresponding query param.

Collection endpoints (`index`, and any nested relation collection) accept
`?limit=` / `?offset=`, resolved in the generated controller's own `index()` method
against the `max_limit` / `max_limit_per_model` config (see
[`Pagination`](src/Pagination.php)) — deliberately not hidden inside `Vifrost::getQuery()`,
so pagination stays visible and editable in the file you actually own. `index()` also
reports how many rows matched (independent of the current page) via an `X-Total-Count`
response header, for building a pager on the client. A model configured as exempt from
pagination (`max_limit_per_model` set to `null`) has no default limit to offset within,
so `?offset=` with no `?limit=` given returns a `422` instead of being silently ignored
— pass an explicit `?limit=` alongside it and it works normally, even for an exempt
model. Single-record endpoints (`show`) never paginate.

You can also generate just one piece:

```bash
php artisan vifrost:request StoreUserRequest User   # FormRequest only
php artisan vifrost:controller User                # Controller only (hidden command, used internally)
```

### Exporting the schema for the JS/TS tooling

```bash
php artisan vifrost:schema [--path=storage/app/vifrost-schema.json]
```

Writes a JSON map of every model's table, resource name, `maxLimit`, columns
(type, nullability, defaults, foreign keys) and relations — this is what
`@vifrost/codegen` (part 2) reads to generate typed model classes. If
`expose_schema_route` is enabled, the same JSON is served live at
`schema_route_path` (`api/_schema` by default) instead of needing the file.

### Caching discovered models

`Vifrost::models()` (used by every generated controller to resolve `{model}` in a URL,
and by `vifrost:api`/`vifrost:schema` to find "all" models) scans `models_path` and
reflects on every file it finds there, on every call — fine for a handful of models
locally, wasteful on a production request. Nothing is cached by default; opt in with:

```bash
php artisan vifrost:cache   # write bootstrap/cache/vifrost-models.php
php artisan vifrost:clear   # remove it, restoring the live scan
```

This follows the same manually-invalidated convention as `config:cache`/`route:cache`:
once a cache file exists, `models()` reads it instead of scanning — so re-run
`vifrost:cache` after adding, removing, or moving a model, the same way you'd re-run
`config:cache` after editing `.env`. There's no automatic invalidation (a model added
by hand, or by any tool other than vifrost's own generators, wouldn't be visible to
trigger one anyway), so add `vifrost:cache` to your deploy step deliberately if you
use it, rather than relying on it locally.

## 2. Models in vanilla JS/TS (`@vifrost/client`)

Framework-agnostic runtime: a `Model` base class, a `QueryBuilder` compatible with
`spatie/laravel-query-builder`'s query params, and an opt-in `Registry` identity map.

### Requirements

- Node 18+ or any modern browser (only depends on native `fetch`)
- TypeScript 5+ recommended

### Installation

```bash
npm install @vifrost/client
npm install --save-dev @vifrost/codegen   # to generate Model classes from your schema
```

### Generating typed model classes

Export the schema from Laravel (part 1), then generate:

```bash
npx vifrost-codegen -i storage/app/vifrost-schema.json -o resources/js/models
```

```
Options:
  -i, --input <pathOrUrl>          schema JSON file path, or the exposed schema route URL
  -o, --output <dir>               directory to write the generated .ts files to
  -t, --type-map <path>            JSON file with { "dbTypeName": "tsType" } overrides
  -c, --client-import <specifier>  import specifier for the runtime client (default: "@vifrost/client")
```

This produces one file per model:

```typescript
// resources/js/models/Product.ts — generated, do not edit by hand
import { Model } from '@vifrost/client'
import { Category } from './Category.js'

export class Product extends Model {
  static resource = 'product'
  static primaryKey = 'id'
  static maxLimit = 100 // null if this model is exempt from pagination

  declare id: number
  declare name: string
  declare price: string
  declare category_id: number

  category(): Promise<Category | null> {
    return this.toOne('category', Category)
  }
}
```

### 2.1 Without a `Registry` (plain query API)

Call `configure()` once, then use each model's static/instance methods directly —
nothing is tracked or cached beyond the lifetime of each call.

```typescript
import { configure } from '@vifrost/client'
import { Category } from './models/Category.js'
import { Product } from './models/Product.js'

configure({ baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com/api' })

// find / all
const product = await Product.find(1)
const allActive = await Product.query().where('status', 'active').limit(10).get()

// Eloquent-like chaining: where / orderBy / with / limit / offset (take/skip aliases)
const products = await Product.query()
  .where('category_id', 3)
  .orderBy('created_at', 'desc')
  .with('category')
  .limit(20)
  .offset(40)
  .get()

// whereId(id).first() — hits the dedicated GET /product/{id} endpoint, not a filtered collection
const one = await Product.query().whereId(1).first()

// relations, from an already-loaded instance
const category = await product.category()          // BelongsTo/HasOne/MorphOne -> Model | null
const relatedProducts = await category.products()   // HasMany/BelongsToMany/etc -> Model[]

// create / update / delete
const created = await new Product({ name: 'New', price: '9.99', category_id: 3 }).save()
created.price = '12.99'
await created.save()          // PUT, since the primary key is now set
await created.delete()
```

If a model declares a non-null `static maxLimit` (i.e. the backend requires
pagination for it), `QueryBuilder` fails fast **client-side**, before any network
request:

```typescript
await Product.all()
// throws: "product requires a limit (max 100). Call .limit(n) (n <= 100) before .get()."

await Product.query().limit(1000).get()
// throws: ".limit(1000) exceeds the max allowed for product (100)."
```

This is stricter than the server, which would silently clamp an over-limit
request — the point is to catch it in development instead of silently returning
a truncated page.

### 2.2 With a `Registry` (identity map, kept in sync)

Pass a `Registry` to `configure()` to opt into an identity map: every `find`/`all`/
`query`/relation fetch registers its rows, `save()`/`delete()` publish into the same
map, and anything can `subscribe()` to a specific `resourceType:id` and get notified
in place — no polling, ready to be driven later by a WebSocket/SSE "record changed"
event via `registry.resync(resourceType, id)`.

```typescript
import { configure, Registry } from '@vifrost/client'
import { Product } from './models/Product.js'

const registry = new Registry()
configure({ baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com/api', registry })

const product = await Product.find(1) // now tracked under "product:1"

const unsubscribe = registry.subscribe('product', 1, (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'updated') {
    console.log('fresh value:', event.value)
  } else {
    console.log('record 1 was deleted')
  }
})

// Any later save() on a Product with id 1 — from anywhere in the app — notifies this listener:
product.name = 'Renamed'
await product.save() // -> listener fires with { type: 'updated', value: product }

await product.delete() // -> listener fires with { type: 'deleted' }, then the entry is untracked

unsubscribe()
```

Without a `Registry` configured, `save()`/`delete()` skip this entirely — the
modularity is deliberate: a consumer who only wants the plain query API never pays
for tracking it doesn't use.

---

## 3. Vue (`@vifrost/vue`)

`useModel`/`useQuery` composables wrapping `@vifrost/client`, reactive to both
their inputs (a ref/getter id or query) and — when a `Registry` is configured — to
`Registry` events for the rows they're currently holding.

### Requirements

- Vue `^3.3.0`
- `@vifrost/client` configured somewhere in your app bootstrap (as in part 2)

### Installation

```bash
npm install @vifrost/vue
```

### 3.1 Without a `Registry`

`useQuery`/`useModel` work the same whether or not a `Registry` is configured — the
difference is only whether results stay in sync after the initial fetch (3.2).

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useModel, useQuery } from '@vifrost/vue'
import { Category } from './models/Category.js'
import { Product } from './models/Product.js'
import { ref } from 'vue'

const productId = ref(1)

// useModel(ModelClass, id) — id can be a plain value, a ref, or a getter
const { data: product, error, isLoading, refetch } = useModel(Product, productId)

// useQuery(builder) — pass a GETTER (not a resolved builder) whenever the query
// depends on something reactive, so it re-runs when that dependency changes
const { data: activeInCategory } = useQuery(() =>
  Product.query().where('category_id', productId.value).where('status', 'active').orderBy('name')
)

// A plain builder is fine too when the query never changes
const { data: categories } = useQuery(Category.query().limit(50))
</script>

<template>
  <p v-if="isLoading">Loading…</p>
  <p v-else-if="error">{{ error }}</p>
  <p v-else>{{ product?.name }}</p>
</template>
```

Both composables return `{ data, error, isLoading, refetch }` — `data` is `null`
(for `useModel`) or `[]` (for `useQuery`) until the first response resolves, and
`refetch()` re-runs the same query on demand.

### 3.2 With a `Registry`

Configure a `Registry` once during app bootstrap (part 2.2) — from a component's
point of view nothing else changes. `useQuery`/`useModel` subscribe to every row
they're currently displaying and patch it in place on an `updated`/`deleted` event,
without an extra network round-trip:

```typescript
// main.ts
import { configure, Registry } from '@vifrost/client'

configure({ baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com/api', registry: new Registry() })
```

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useModel } from '@vifrost/vue'
import { Product } from './models/Product.js'

const { data: product } = useModel(Product, 1)

async function rename() {
  product.value!.name = 'Renamed'
  await product.value!.save() // any other component's useModel(Product, 1) updates too
}
</script>
```

Because `useModel(Product, 1)` is built on `useQuery` (it resolves through
`Product.query().whereId(1)`, the same endpoint `find()` uses), any two components
that fetched product `1` independently share the same `Registry` entry — a `save()`
in one updates the other's `data` reactively, with no manual event wiring.
